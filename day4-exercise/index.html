            This weeks featured game is Dark Souls III a game of valleys and peaks, down through dungeons and up over castle walls. It's a plummet 
            into places we shouldn't be, an escape from places we don't belong.

            But of course, we fight our way through the darkness, and find our way out. There are a few stumbles along the way, but in the end, Dark 
            Souls III is well worth the riveting climb.
