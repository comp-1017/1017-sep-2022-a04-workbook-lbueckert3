        <h1>Top Ten Social Media Sites</h1>
        <p>
            The world's most popular social networking sites certainly have
            changed over the years, and they'll undoubtedly continue to change
            as time moves forward. Old social networks will die, popular ones
            will stick around as they're forced to evolve, and brand new ones
            will appear.

            Most of us already know that Facebook is the top social network on
            the web. It's a thriving beast of a social networking site on the
            web with over 1.59 billions monthly active users as of December 2015
            and over one billion that log on daily (according to Facebook
            itself). Statistashows that Facebook Messenger is also the second
            most popular messaging app behind WhatsApp. After failing to acquire
            Snapchat in 2013, Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 so that it
            could be the one that was one top of instant messaging.
