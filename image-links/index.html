        <h1>Top Ten Social Media Sites</h1>
        <p>
            The world's most popular social networking sites certainly have
            changed over the years, and they'll undoubtedly continue to change
            as time moves forward. Old social networks will die, popular ones
            will stick around as they're forced to evolve, and brand new ones
            will appear.
        </p>
        <h3>Facebook</h3>

                <p>
                    Most of us already know that Facebook is the top social network on
                    the web. It's a thriving beast of a social networking site on the
                    web with over 1.59 billions monthly active users as of December 2015
                    and over one billion that log on daily (according to Facebook
                    itself). Statistics shows that Facebook Messenger is also the second
                    most popular messaging app behind WhatsApp. After failing to acquire
                    Snapchat in 2013, Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 so that it
                    could be the one that was one top of instant messaging.
                </p>
        <h3>Twitter</h3>

                    <p>
                        Twitter is known as the real-time, publicmicroblogging network where news breaks first. 
                        Most users loved it for its iconic 140-character limit and unfiltered feed that showed 
                        them absolutely everything. Twitter has changed dramatically over the years, and today 
                        it's criticized a lot for going the way of looking and functioning almost exactly like 
                        Facebook. Besides Twitter Card integration, which now makes it easy to share all sorts 
                        of multimedia content in tweets, you can expect to see algorithmic timelines coming to 
                        Twitter soon as well.  
                    </p>
        <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
            <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" targer="_blank"><img src="img/image-5.jpg" alt="logo linkedin"
                title="Click here to Access LinkedIn"></a>
                    <p>
                        LinkedIn is a social network for professionals. Anyone who needs to make connections to 
                        advance their careers should be on LinkedIn. Profiles are designed to look sort of like 
                        extremely detailed resumes, with sections for work experience, education, volunteer work, 
                        certifications, awards and all sorts of other relevant work-related information. Users 
                        can promote themselves and their businesses by making connections with other professionals, 
                        interacting in group discussions, posting job ads, applying to jobs, publishing articles to 
                        LinkedIn pulse and so much more.  
                    </p>
        <h3>Google+</h3>
            <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"><img src="img/image-3.jpg" alt="logo google+" title="Click here to Access Google"></a>
                    <p>
                        Making its debut in the early summer of 2011, Google+ became the fastest growing social 
                        network the web has ever seen. After failing a couple times already with Google Buzz and 
                        Google Wave, the search giant finally succeeded at creating something that stuck... kind 
                        of. Nobody really needed another Facebook clone, so Google+ had always been widely criticized 
                        for being a social network that nobody really used. In late 2015, a brand new Google+ was 
                        rolled out to put more emphasis on its Communities and Collections features to help 
                        differentiate the platform a bit more and give existing users more of what they wanted.

        <h3>Youtube</h3>

                        Where does everyone go to watch or share video content online? It's obviously YouTube. 
                        After Google, YouTube is the second largest search engine. Despite being owned by Google, 
                        YouTube can still be recognized as a separate social network all on its own as the premiere 
                        place online to go to watch videos on every topic under the sun and upload your own as well. 
                        From music videos and movies, to personal vlogs and independent films, YouTube has it all. 
                        YouTube recently launched a premium subscription option, called YouTube Red, which removes 
                        all advertisements from videos.
