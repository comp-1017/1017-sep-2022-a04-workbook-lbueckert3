        <h3>Anchor Tag (aka; Linking to another page)</h3>
        <!-- blocked paired
            This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often refered to as the link tag.
            One should not use the link tag, because there is actually a <link> tag used in the <head> section.
            The anchor tag can take you to a different location whether it be on a different website, different page in the current website,
                or a different location on the current page.    
                
            Parameters:
                href: points to the desired location
                target: indicates the browser page display option
                    default is same display page tab
                    _blank will open a new browser tab

        <h3>Image Tag</h3>
        <!--
            an empty (void) tag
            it is NOT a paired 
            An image tag does not have a closing tag
            the image tag has NO content, however, it does have parameters

            parameters:
                src="relative web site location"
                alt="printable text if the image is not found at src"
                [title="tool tip text for the image"]

            Absolute addressing is a complete fixed file path, that includes your drive:/folder/...folder/filename.ext
            A Relative Address begins at a specified point. For websites, it is considered the "top of the website"
                reference to the desired filename is done by specifying the appropriate folder path to the desired file.
            NO DRIVE LETTER

            Movement within a relative address
                if only the filename is given, the location is within the same folder.
                movement down the file structure is by /foldername
                movement up the file structure is by using .. for each folder level to ascend
            
            same folder
                ="filename.ext"
            lower folder
                ="nextleveldownfoldername/nextleveldownfoldername/.../filename.ext"
            from one lower folder to another lower folder on a different branch
             (.. for each level that needs to be ascended)
                ="../../../nextleveldownfoldername/filename.ext"
